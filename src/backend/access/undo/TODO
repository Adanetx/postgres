* things that worked before the URS refactor but need to be fully restored to working order
** undo logs not getting recycled properly when you exit!
** support for unlogged and temporary tables
** support for tablespaces
** simulate undo log full, so that multi-chunk URS can be tested

* fix up chunk headers after recovery
* recreate undo requests after recovery
* mark buffer dirty happening at the wrong time (should be before page LSN)
* crash recovery not working properly in some cases
* multi-chunk URSs are not fully implemented yet
* let's use functions instead of procedures for the new pg_proc stuff

* xid8_undo_status() -- committed, undo needed, ...?
* design a new discard worker
